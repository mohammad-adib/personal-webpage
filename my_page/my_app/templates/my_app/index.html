        I'm really fascinated with programming. Recently, I've began learning full stack web developing via the robust
         <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> framework. I've also created some simple web applications.

        I also dabble in graphic design building logos and icons for web, creating celebration postcard, enhancing raw photographs,
        and sometimes playing around with images just for fun! You can find some of my ideas in <a href="{% url 'my_app:personal' %}">here</a>.</p>
