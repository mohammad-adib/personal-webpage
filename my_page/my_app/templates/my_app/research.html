            <p class="start-paragraph">High speed gas jet when placed close enough to a liquid surface can penetrate deep into the liquid,
              and create a complex (and quite a bit messy!) multiphase phenomenon. The gas flow pushes down the liquid leaving a cavity in the surface,
               and the liquid pushes back to fill the cavity. This cycle continues forever. The liquid surface exhibits an irregular oscillatory patterns of behavior
                which are almost impossible to predict. This project (originally part of my Masters' thesis) deals with observing this behavior in the lab,
                and CFD simulation of it in a specific settings for an air-water system.</p>

            <p class="start-paragraph">The simulation is based on an axisymmetric approach, the volume of fluid (VOF) model (for tracking the interface and address multiphase nature),
              and k-&omega; SST turbulence model. Reproducing the essential features of the oscillatory behavior of the interface such cavity depth and formation of
              ligaments and sheets in the simulation as well as evaluating the accuracy of the numerical results are on the agenda here.</p>

            <p class="start-paragraph">
              <i>Dispersion</i> is the process through which the turbulence of carrier fluid affects the transport and distribution of the carried particles. Technically speaking, dispersion modelling means reconstructing
              fluctuating velocity components of carried phase from known flow quantities (calculated from the Eulerian solution) and adding that to the mean values at the location of discerete particles
               (tracked via Lagrangian appraoch). Here, four different dispersion models are applied to a swirling flow contained in a chamber. The particles in different sizes are injected through the central air flow,
               and then mix with swirling annulus flow at outer radius. Some of them find the way to the end of chamber and some are trapped in the vortex the upper periphery section of the chamber
               based on their size and velocity.

            <p class="start-paragraph">The animation below from compiled from simulation results show the particles developing in the swirling flow:</p>

            <p class=" start-paragraph">Three continuous random walk models, including Sommerfeldâ€™s model, Moissette et al. (MOB) model, and probability density function (PDF),
              and the conventionally used eddy life time (ELT) model are compared.  The ELT model which is still the default dispersion model in commercial softwares like Ansys Fluent produce the largest errors for
              all particle statistics, especially for the fluctuating velocities while other models, especially MOB and PDF, bring about a satisfactory agreement with the reference experiment measurements with
              MOB being the most accurate model in predicting the cross-stream particle velocity fluctuations with errors less than 20%.

            <p class="start-paragraph">The finite difference method along with projection method is applied to 3D laminar Navier-Stokes equations in a helical square duct. Since the solution is not tied to
               a predefined grid, a wide range of geometrical parameters including curvature, torsion, and aspect ratio are studied to see how they alter the flow regime in terms of
                the axial velocity, secondary flows pattern, and friction factor. The whole set of simulation are done using a home-made CFD code (written in Fortran) developed specifically for this project.

                Here, Al2O3 nanofluid flow between two concenteric cylinders is studied. The iso-thermal inner cylinder hotter than the outer cylinder
                rotates and moves axially upwards against the direction of gravity.
                A uniform external electromagnetic field is also present the effect of which is represented by the non-dimentional Hartman Number in the flow simulation.
                The intensity of the electromagnetic field alters both velocity and temperature distirbution of the nanofluid in the domain.

            <p class="start-paragraph">
              Solar collectors absorb the radiation from the sun and transform it to heat via a transfer medium.Two prevalent collector formats are Flat Plate Collector
               and Evacuated Tube Collector. One advantage of evacuated tube solar collectors is that they are relatively insensitive to the direction of sunlight,
               while flat plates can suffer from additional reflection if the direction of sunlight is not suitable. Solar water heaters, a particular
               type of evacuated tube collectors, is of high importance because of their widely domestic use. A solar water heater system often needs a booster (storage unit)
               to provide heat whenever little or no solar energy is available.
            </p>
            <p class="start-paragraph">
              Among various methods for heat storage, the use of solidâ€“liquid phase change materials has attracted considerable attention. In this method, the heat pipe is immersed
              inside the phase change material, where heat is effectively accumulated and stored for an extended period of time due to thermal insulation of evacuated tubes.
              The benefit of this method includes improved functionality by delayed release of heat, thus providing hot water during the hours of high demand or when solar
              intensity is insufficient.
            </p>
            <p class="start-paragraph">
                This project specifically deals with a 2D simulation of a PCM-integrated sollar collector to study how using two different PCM, namely Erythritol and Tritriacontane, improves
                the operation of the solar collector. The heat pipe fin temperature shows a more uniform during simulation time in both normal and stagnation conditons.
